gcc has a few switches
`-Wall` - produces warning messages when it detects possible errors
`-W` - Issues additional warning messages beyond those produced by `-Wall`
`-pedantic` - Issues all warnings required by the C standard. Causes programs that use nonstandard featuers to be rejected
`-ansi` - Turns off features of GCC that arent standard C and enables a few standard features that are normally disabled.
`-std=c99` or `-std=c89` - Specifies which stanrdard of C the compiler should use to check to the program
